# Intro to iOS Development

Hi there! Welcome to our introductory iOS app development workshop. We’re so excited to have you :)

## Learning Objectives

This workshop series will expose participants to…

1. Fundamental [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) syntax and concepts
2. How to think critically about user interfaces
3. How to build user interfaces for iOS with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
4. How to accept and respond to user interaction

## Technology Setup

In order to participate in this workshop, we’ll need to make sure you have all of the required software.

### macOS Update

To make sure we can install and run the latest versions of all of the necessary tools, we will make sure we are all running the latest version of macOS. On your Mac, click on the  icon in your menu bar and click on “About this Mac”.

A window like this will open. If it says you’re running “Version 12.5.1”, you’re all set! You can skip to the Xcode installation. Otherwise, click on “Software Update” and update to the latest macOS version.

### Xcode Installation

iOS developers use Xcode to build, run, and deploy their apps. It's an IDE full of useful development tools such as a fantastic code editor, great debugging tools, and Simulators that allow you to run iOS apps directly on your Mac!!

1. Click [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) to download (or update) Xcode from the Mac App Store. We will be running this workshop expecting you to be using Xcode 13.4.1.
   - Warning: This might take a significant amount of time depending on your network speed. Try not to let your computer go to sleep while it downloads to reduce the risk of failure.
2. After installation has completed, open Xcode from your Applications folder and complete all of the onboarding stages.
3. When you see this window, you've successfully installed Xcode!!
